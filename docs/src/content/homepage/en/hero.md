This library was heavily inspired by <a href="https://sonner.emilkowal.ski/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="link">Sonner by Emilkowalski</a> and its main feature of stackable toasts are from that library. It is for React, so this library was made mostly for Vanilla JavaScript. Go check it out.
