# ToastMyNuts

ToastMyNuts is a lightweight and customizable toast notification library designed for use in web applications. With ToastMyNuts, you can easily display informative and visually appealing toast notifications to your users, enhancing their overall experience.

Thanks to [Sonner Toast by Emilkowalski](https://sonner.emilkowal.ski) as I got the idea of stacking toasts from his project.
